# AINA Specification v0.1  
## AI-Native Governance Architecture

## 1. Introduction

AI-Native Governance Architecture (AINA) is a conceptual research framework proposing a layered governance model for AI systems, defining autonomy ceilings, responsibility flows, and human decision enforcement mechanisms.

The goal of AINA is to provide a structured governance architecture for AI-assisted decision-making systems, emphasizing human accountability and controlled autonomy.

This document represents the v0.1 conceptual framework proposal. No implementation, experiments, or policy deployment are included.

## 2. Background and Problem Statement

As AI systems increasingly influence human decisions, the lack of structured governance frameworks introduces risks including hallucinations, unchecked autonomy, and unclear responsibility attribution.

Current AI governance discussions remain fragmented across policy, technical safety, and organizational management. AINA proposes an integrated architectural framework to unify these perspectives.

---

## 3. Framework Overview

AINA is structured as a layered governance architecture with explicit autonomy ceilings and responsibility flows.

Core principles:

- Prompt as cognitive safety mechanism
- System as behavioral control infrastructure
- Human as final accountability authority

---

## 4. Layered Governance Architecture

### Layer 0: AI Generation  
The AI model generates outputs based on prompts and system instructions.

### Layer 1: Prompt Governance  
Mechanisms for claim detection, evidence requirement, and risk disclosure embedded in prompts.

### Layer 2: Verification System  
Automated fact-checking, policy rule enforcement, logging, and audit trails.

### Layer 3: Human Decision Layer  
Human approval workflows, risk committees, and decision gates.

### Layer 4: Execution and Accountability  
Organizational execution with explicit responsibility attribution to human authorities.

## 5. AI Autonomy Ceiling Taxonomy

AINA defines autonomy levels to restrict AI operational authority:

- L0: Tool (no decision authority)
- L1: Recommendation system
- L2: Decision support (human mandatory)
- L3: Restricted execution (human mandatory)
- L4: Full autonomy (prohibited)

---

## 6. Responsibility Flow Model

Responsibility attribution is defined as:

AI → System → Organization → Human Authority

This model ensures that AI systems cannot be considered autonomous moral or legal agents.

---

## 7. Organizational Deployment Blueprint

AINA can be deployed in organizations through:

- Governance policy documents
- AI approval workflows
- Logging and audit systems
- Risk review committees

---

## 8. Application Domains

Potential application domains include:

- Enterprise AI decision support
- Government AI governance frameworks
- High-risk AI domains (finance, healthcare, defense)
- Research and academic AI collaboration environments

---

## 9. Limitations and Future Work

AINA v0.1 is purely conceptual and does not include:

- Technical implementation
- Empirical validation
- Policy integration frameworks

Future versions will explore:

- Failure taxonomy and risk economics models
- Policy mapping to AI regulations (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF)
- Reference system architecture and prototypes

---

## 10. Conclusion

AINA proposes a conceptual AI governance architecture integrating technical, organizational, and human accountability layers. This framework serves as an initial research proposal toward standardized AI governance architectures.
