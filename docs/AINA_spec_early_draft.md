# AINA Early Draft Notes

This document contains early conceptual thoughts, sketches, and intellectual history before formalizing AINA specifications.

This file is intentionally informal and may contain incomplete, speculative, or rejected ideas.

---

## Initial Motivation

- AI systems increasingly influence human decisions, but governance structures are fragmented.
- Prompt engineering alone is insufficient for controlling AI behavior at civilizational scale.
- Need for layered governance architecture separating cognitive, system, organizational, and human accountability layers.

---

## Core Concept Sketch

### Layered Governance Idea (Initial Sketch)

- Layer 0: AI model generation
- Layer 1: Prompt-based cognitive safety mechanisms
- Layer 2: System-level verification and logging
- Layer 3: Human decision authority
- Layer 4: Organizational execution and legal responsibility

---

## Autonomy Ceiling Idea

- AI should never operate as full autonomous agent in high-risk domains.
- Autonomy levels taxonomy proposed:
  - L0 Tool
  - L1 Recommendation
  - L2 Decision Support
  - L3 Restricted Execution
  - L4 Full Autonomy (Prohibited)

---

## Responsibility Flow Hypothesis

- AI is not a moral or legal subject.
- Responsibility must flow:
  AI → System → Organization → Human Authority

---

## Open Questions

- How to formalize AI governance as system architecture rather than policy text?
- How to integrate human cognitive constraints into AI workflow design?
- Can AI collaboration cognitive state be serialized as protocol artifact?

---

## Speculative Ideas (Unvalidated)

- Cognitive State Serialization for AI collaboration
- Context Bootstrap Protocol for persistent AI research workflows
- Governance Failure Economics Model (AI risk as economic externality)

---

## Rejected / Uncertain Ideas

- Fully autonomous AI governance agents (high risk, unclear accountability)
- Prompt-only governance (insufficient systemic control)
- Treating AI as legal agent (currently philosophically and legally unstable)

---

## Future Directions

- Formal specification v0.1
- Failure taxonomy and risk economics model
- Policy mapping to AI regulations (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF)
- Reference system architecture (pseudo-implementation)
